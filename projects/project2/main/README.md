# Artist's Statement

Albeit similar to my last project from last semester, it turned out a lot cleaner thanks to the already provided physics established by Phaser 3, though it proved equally as challenging.

In this version, I was aiming to improve the quality of my coding, offer more to the program and improve on the visuals (although I know that was not the premise of this assignment).

In terms of functions, it turned out nearly identical to the first iteration, but was developed from scratch and through more efficient means.

For example, managing scenes on Phaser 3 is much better than doing so using states on P5, not to mention a lot more organizing.

Repeating objects and tweaking their attributes such as mass and friction is made easy, however if one were to look at my code they would see that there is still a lot to improve in that department.

Still it is a big step considering that it has only been about a month since I started learning about the engine.

Another big thing that was accomplished was the implementation of moveable objects, something which I originally desired in the original version.

Then there was a larger scale world along with a camera that follows the player, as in the original version, I was limited in terms of what I could put on a canvas.

Although aesthetics was not a primary assessment for the project, it still pleased me to utilize the sprite animation functions within Phaser 3. Along with that, there were cursor key functions which initialization those animated sprites at the press of a button.

Finally, the physics engine itself was very amusing to manipulate. Character velocity, gravity, and movement felt so smooth in comparison to my last project.

I could have taken this a lot further but began feeling burned out towards the final weeks, and decided to scope down on the scale of the project that was originally intended by focusing more on its functionality.

It was a fun project, and I would be glad to continue developing it over the coming semesters if given the chance. My next step would be to work around a 3D engine, which I know is possible through a plugin known as “enable3D” which I have linked an example of bellow. As well as applying matter physics for more complicated objects and wider variety of shapes aside from just cubes, along with a more vibrant and realistic feel.
