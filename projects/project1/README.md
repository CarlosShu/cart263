# Artist's Statement.

My concept for this project is directly based off of old-school video game graphics from the NES era, specifically similar to cut-scenes from Ninja Gaiden.

My original plan was to summarize the entirety of The Karate Kid (1984), but early on I realized that this was way too ambitious in regards to the overall length of the film; so I ended up choosing a segment from The Twilight Zone (1959) in response to a recent trend of theories regarding the concept of the currently popular television series WandaVision which I am watching and following very religiously.

The episode tells the story of a society living under the tyranny of a child born with supernatural abilities. The genre of the short film seemingly falls into a degree between horror and fantasy. To capture this essence, I chose not to emphasize as much on the scare factor, rather on the story-telling as a whole, the moral of the segment that many tend to analyze being that one should not spoil their children.

Regarding the visuals, I decided to cut out all of shots that I regarded as filler and only work with the ones that were essential to the plot to save myself time and not over-lengthen my project which ended up being a little over 40 slides long. I used a software to capture then import the images onto Photoshop where I could limit the colors and pixelate the images.

As for the technical aspect, this was as expected the trickiest part to pull off. I sought to seek help on the classâ€™ discord and online sources for a few and unique special effects that I wanted to integrate into my film but lacked the knowledge on how to do so such as with the typewriter function and the fade effects. Nonetheless, I ended up having to tweak them and through the struggles I learned a lot.

One of the biggest issues was trying to clean up my code, as I originally had everything set within the main script, making it appear more complicated and long. I managed to get help on how to simplify the use of repetitive functions as originally each slide was its own, and have every line of dialogue be situated within one JSON file which could then be called upon. This process ended up making everything so much easier and so much neater, although there are still some things that can be improved on.
